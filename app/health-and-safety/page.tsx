            <li>Structural safety for sets and rigging.</li>
            <li>Crowd control and traffic management for public location shoots.</li>
            <li>Adherence to specialized safety protocols for sports and high-velocity filming.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Roles & Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>
            Safety is a shared responsibility. We ensure that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Production Managers and Directors are briefed on site-specific risks.</li>
            <li>All crew members receive appropriate safety induction before filming begins.</li>
            <li>Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is provided where necessary.</li>

        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>4. Incident Reporting</h2>
          <p>
            In accordance with Singapore law, all workplace incidents, near-misses, and dangerous occurrences must be reported to the Production Manager immediately. Notifiable incidents will be reported to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) as required by the WSHA.
